# Liferay React Native Demo App

An example app for Liferay utilizing Liferay's headless apis.

## Setup the Code

Please provide feedback for this. If you find anything is missing add an issue to this repo so I can update the steps. Or even better, send a pull request. ;)

This is a JavaScript applicaiton so you will need node and npm installed.

This Liferay React Native App is built using [Expo](https://expo.io/) which simplifies the creation of React Native apps. https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#using-expo-cli

` $ npx expo install`

` $ npx expo start`

## Authentication

The App can be configured to use either OAuth2 or Basic Auth.

### OAuth2

To set OAuth2 up on Liferay you will need to create a new OAuth application through Liferay's administration. Configure it as shown in the image below.

![Configuration](/dev-assets/OAuthConfiguration.png)

You will then need to enable scopes to give the OAuth application access to Liferay. I've found this to be a little finnicky and thus simply enabled everything. To test any changes you make to scopes, you will need to log out and back in on the app.

![Scopes](/dev-assets/OAuthScopes.png)

At this point it should be working.

## Permissioned Images

Viewing images that do not include guest permissions may require additional configuration in your Liferay instance. If you are using basic Auth make sure "System Settings > API Authentication > Basic Auth Header" includes your image's base url. For example: `/o/adaptive-media/*`.

## Android Emulator

In order to connect to you local Liferay instance from an Android emulator you will need to `Liferay Server URL` from the Configurations page to `http://10.0.2.2:8080`.
